# "darltrash", huh?
Hello! My name is Nelson Lopez, I'm 15 and I make stuff I never actually finish!

### What do you mean?
Well, i had finished [ONE game](https://github.com/darltrash/AlienGame) but it really sucks and it is made on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

Really, it is horrible and i made it only to get high marks on tech class lol.

### Do you do stuff other than coding?
Absolutely! I do all sorts of stuff but i also never finish anything(, sorry)

I have a [SoundCloud Page](https://soundcloud.com/narvise) but I never upload anything because I'm busy doing other stuff.

I also had an art account on [Instagram](https://instagram.com) but I ended removing it.

### What are your current projects?
MoonLight: A comic about a wolf monster that tries to hide as a human (NOT PUBLIC YET)

[MoonRPG](https://github.com/moonsteal/moonrpg): An action-RPG game about being a monster fish and killing robots with water 

Super Generic BXMBS Game!: A game about a raccoon that blows things up (NOT PUBLIC YET)
