## assert(darltrash.ADHD, "No memory nor attention left!")
as you may see, i have plenty abandoned repositories and ideas that i will maybe never ever be able to finish, so dont expect anything coming from me or you will get decepted

> Note: Recently acquired some ritalin and i have been through a process of learning about myself and treating my ADHD, and apparently it's working! Still, dont count on me lol
