# "darltrash", huh?
Hello! My name is Nelson Lopez, I'm 15 and I make stuff I never actually finish!

### What do you mean?
Well, i had finished ONE game but it really sucks and it is made on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

Really, it is horrible and i made it only to get high marks on tech class lol.

### Do you do stuff other than coding?
